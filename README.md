# RerouteChat
This is a Spigot based plugin for Minecraft 1.19.1 and above. The purpose of this plugin is to reroute a player's chat message to make the server say it so that the message can not be highlighted on and reported to Microsoft. However, until 1.19.1 for Bukkit, Spigot, and Paper are rolled out, this plugin is purely theoretical. As of current testing on Minecraft Snapshot 1.19.1-pre2 with the vanilla server jar file, server messages/announcements are not reportable which gave me the idea for this plugin.

To install this plugin, simply download the jar file given and put it into your server's plugins folder. Upon starting your server, you should get a confirmation notifivation in the console saying "RerouteChat is running". You know this plugin is working properly if player names are no longer encased in <> when they send a message, but will instead have their names in [] instead.

If you encounter any errors or have any suggestions on how to improve this project, please feel free to leave an issue!
